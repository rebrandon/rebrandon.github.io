### 👋 Who is Brandon?
Welcome to my corner of the Pokémon world! I've been a fan since the Generation 1 days. I got Pokémon Blue on my 10th birthday starting my journey in the Pokémon world similar to Ash from the Pokémon anime. After 26 years of training Pokémon, I've turned my focus toward the ultimate challenge: the **Shiny Living Dex**.

### 🏆 Shiny Hunting Philosophy
I love exploring new methods to shiny hunting as I work to complete my end goal of one of every single Pokémon in shiny form. Some may be unavailable to me, but I will work tirelessly to see them in my Pokémon Home.

### 🎮 Fun Facts
* **First Shiny:** First seen shiny was a Mankey in Pokémon Gold, but I ran out of PokéBalls trying to capture it. Later in Pokémon Emerald, I caught a beautiful shiny Golbat that has traveled through the generations to Pokémonn home where it lives to this day. Love my pic bat baby named BUCKY!
* **Favorite Pokémon:** Slaking (The true King)
* **Current Goal:** Securing the Shiny Charm in Pokémon Legends Arceus.
