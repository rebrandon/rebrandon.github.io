### The Story
BUCKY is my Crobat that I caught many, many years ago in Emerald. I remember catching it as a Golbat in Meteor Falls while EV training. Because it's been decades since catching, I don't have any memory of exact dates, but I know that Crobat will always be my first shiny, and without a doubt, one of my all-time favorite Pokémon.
